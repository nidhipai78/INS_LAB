# Monoalphabetic Cipher Implementation

## Overview

This implements the Monoalphabetic Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a fixed corresponding letter from a scrambled alphabet.

## Features

1.Key-based encryption and decryption

2.Case-insensitive processing

3.Alphabetic characters only

4.Simple and efficient implementation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How It Works

1.The plaintext is processed letter by letter.

2.Each letter is mapped to its corresponding letter from the key alphabet.

3.The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

3.Non-alphabetic characters are not altered.

## How To Run

This program can be run in:
1. GitHub Codespaces for the file Monoalphabetic Cipher.ipynb
2. Google Collab using this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hU3FuHzzxfrnPt8FlTaNVHy5o9KDj35q"> link

## Configuration

- Custom alphabet key

- Case-insensitive processing

## Security Considerations

- Monoalphabetic ciphers are vulnerable to frequency analysis.

- Use randomized and long keys for better security.

- Avoid using predictable key patterns.

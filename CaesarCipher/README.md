# Caesar Cipher
This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques, which shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of positions.

<b>Features</b><br>
1.Encryption: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting characters.<br>
2.Decryption: Convert ciphertext back to plaintext using the reverse shift.<br>
3.Shift customization: Specify any shift value for encryption/decryption.<br>

<b>Installation</b><br>
This project is intended to be used in Google Colab, there is no need for any installation.

<b> How to Run</b><br>
You can open the project directly using the CaesarCipher.ipynb folder in this repository which directs to Google Colab or using this link <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wS_9nJbkDQgyUfBK_pS1rjc_W1-dYOwH">Click here</a> <br>
